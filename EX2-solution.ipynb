Since a complete graph on 40 nodes has (n(n-1)):2=780 edges, and any partition into equal subsets results in a cut of size 400 (20 nodes in each subset with all 20x20 edges between subsets cut), we can estimate our objective function value. We are examining an Erdos-Renyi random graph with an edge probability of 20%, we can estimate a cut of size approximately 20% of 400, or 80 edges.
